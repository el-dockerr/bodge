# Release Process for Bodge

This document describes how to create releases with automatic binary generation for Bodge.

## Automated Binary Releases

When you create a release, GitHub Actions automatically builds binaries for:
- **Windows (x64)** - `bodge-windows-x64.zip`
- **Linux (x64)** - `bodge-linux-x64.tar.gz`  
- **macOS (x64)** - `bodge-macos-x64.tar.gz`

Each archive contains:
- The `bodge` executable (or `bodge.exe` on Windows)
- `README.md` with project information
- `example.bodge` configuration file
- `.bodge` file used to build Bodge itself

## Creating a Release

### Method 1: Using the Release Scripts (Recommended)

#### On Windows:
```cmd
scripts\create-release.bat v1.0.0
```

#### On Linux/macOS:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/create-release.sh
./scripts/create-release.sh v1.0.0
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Validate version format
2. ‚úÖ Check for uncommitted changes
3. ‚úÖ Pull latest changes from main
4. ‚úÖ Build and test locally
5. ‚úÖ Create and push the git tag
6. ‚úÖ Trigger automated binary builds

### Method 2: Manual Process

1. **Prepare the release**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you're on main branch and up to date
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   
   # Build and test locally
   make clean && make all
   ./bodge help  # Test the build
   ```

2. **Create and push tag**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Complete the release on GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com/el-dockerr/bodge/releases
   - Edit the auto-created draft release
   - Add release notes
   - Publish the release

## Release Workflow Details

### What Happens Automatically

1. **Trigger**: When you push a tag starting with `v` or publish a GitHub release

2. **Build Matrix**: 
   - Ubuntu Latest (Linux x64)
   - Windows Latest (Windows x64) 
   - macOS Latest (macOS x64)

3. **Build Process**:
   - Install platform-specific dependencies
   - Build using `make` (Linux/macOS) or `make.bat` (Windows)
   - Test basic functionality (`bodge help`, `bodge list`)
   - Strip debug symbols (Linux/macOS) to reduce file size
   - Create archives with binary and documentation

4. **Upload Process**:
   - Upload binaries as GitHub release assets
   - Generate SHA256 checksums for verification
   - Attach checksums file to the release

### Archive Contents

Each platform archive contains:
```
bodge-{platform}-x64/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bodge(.exe)           # The main executable
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Project documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example.bodge         # Example configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .bodge               # Bodge's own build config
```

### Checksum Verification

A `checksums.txt` file is generated with SHA256 hashes:
```
a1b2c3d4... bodge-windows-x64.zip
e5f6g7h8... bodge-linux-x64.tar.gz
i9j0k1l2... bodge-macos-x64.tar.gz
```

Users can verify downloads:
```bash
# Linux/macOS
sha256sum -c checksums.txt

# Windows PowerShell
Get-FileHash bodge-windows-x64.zip -Algorithm SHA256
```

## Version Numbering

Follow semantic versioning (SemVer):
- **v1.0.0** - Major release with breaking changes
- **v1.1.0** - Minor release with new features
- **v1.0.1** - Patch release with bug fixes
- **v1.0.0-beta** - Pre-release versions

## Release Notes Template

```markdown
## What's New in v1.0.0

### üöÄ New Features
- Added multi-target support for libraries and executables
- Implemented build sequences for complex workflows
- Cross-platform file operations (copy, remove, mkdir)

### üîß Improvements  
- Better error messages and logging
- Improved Windows compatibility
- Static linking support to eliminate DLL dependencies

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed configuration parsing edge cases
- Resolved path handling issues on Windows

### üì¶ Downloads
The binaries are automatically attached to this release:
- Windows: `bodge-windows-x64.zip`
- Linux: `bodge-linux-x64.tar.gz` 
- macOS: `bodge-macos-x64.tar.gz`

Verify downloads using the `checksums.txt` file.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
- Ensure all platforms can build (test locally first)
- Verify dependencies are correctly installed in the workflow

### Missing Binaries
- Confirm the release workflow completed successfully
- Check that the tag follows the `v*` pattern
- Ensure the release was published (not just drafted)

### Checksum Mismatches
- Re-download the file (may be corrupted)
- Check if you downloaded the correct file
- Report issues if checksums consistently fail
