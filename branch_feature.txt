This feature branch has the following changes:

As a developer it should be possible to checkout code from git repositories and refer my code to it.
The bodge shall identify those resources and must be able to fetch them and make use of sources or linked libraries.
If commanded it can scan the repository for existing bodge files as well and build them if needed.

Future commands in bodge file:

dependency: https://git...
build: true/false [optional, default: false]
destination: some/subfolder/ or /some/system/folder [optional - default repository name]

with every build bodge check if the repo has changed.
You can proceed builds and add this repositories as dependencies or as linked.

To have the dependencies in place we add a new command called `bodge fetch`. This command will fetch sources forefront to make it easier for IDEs.
Despite this feature minor bugfixes was applied and git build chain will be changed to maintain download of binaries.

Version after merge will be 0.0.8
